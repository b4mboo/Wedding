# Ciara and Paul’s Wedding Ceremony

Good afternoon, everybody.  My name is Bill Chase and I’m here this afternoon to act as celebrant for Ciara and Paul’s wedding. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you all here on this very happy occasion. We welcome those from Ireland, those from the UK, and those who have travelled great distances from overseas.

All of you are very special in some way to Ciara and Paul, and that is why they have asked you to be here in Lismore Castle to share in their happiness and joy, to be with them as they publicly declare their love and their commitment to one another. 

Ciara & Paul don’t like to do things by halves. Whether it’s at work, or at home, or in improving their own or the lives of people around them, they are committed to getting things right, and to making sure that the little details are taken care of. It’s this level of commitment that they want to bring to their wedding, their love, and their life together that will follow.

The most important detail today is about celebrating that love and commitment. This celebration is about them, but it’s also about you. You are here to celebrate the joy of the occasion, to share in the love between Ciara and Paul, and to bear witness to the solemnity of the tradition of marriage.

Choosing to get married is one of the most important decisions that two people will ever make. Marriage is a vow of permanence, a sign of unity and loyalty, honoured through times to come. Marriage is a pledge, a commitment to help and support each other through all that life in the future may bring, and to stand together forevermore.

## READING
I'd like to invite Elizabeth, Paul's youngest sister to read "The One". Ciara read this at her sister's wedding.

### The One (Unknown Author)
When the one whose hand you’re holding
Is the one who holds your heart,
When the one whose eyes you gaze into
Gives your hopes and dreams their start,
When the one you think of first and last
Is the one who holds you tight
And the things you plan together
Make the whole world seem just right,
When the one whom you believe in
Puts their faith and trust in you,
You’ve found the one and only love
You’ll share your whole life through

We are gathered here to witness Ciara and Paul join in the bonds of matrimony. It is one of life’s richest surprises when the accidental meeting of two life paths lead them together along the common path of husband and wife, and it is one of life’s finest experiences when a relationship grows into a permanent bond of love. This meeting and this growth bring us together, here, today.

We don’t know what the future may bring into the life of this couple, but we hope that together they may be equal to the needs of their tomorrows. May they have patience in time of strain, strength in time of weakness, courage in time of discouragement, vision in time of doubt, and above all, growing love. May the love in your hearts and the greatness of life’s possibilities give you joy, the awareness of your friends and families’ good wishes give you peace and strength.

## READING
I'd like to invite Ciara and Paul's friend Michael to read The Art of Marriage by Wilferd A. Peterson

The little things are the big things.
It is never being too old to hold hands. 
It is remembering to say "I love you" at least once a day.

It is never going to sleep angry. 
It is at no time taking the other for granted; 
the courtship should not end with the honeymoon, 
it should continue through all the years.

It is having a mutual sense of values and common objectives. 
It is standing together facing the world. 
It is forming a circle of love that gathers in the whole family. 
It is doing things for each other, not in the attitude of duty or sacrifice, 
but in the spirit of joy.

It is speaking words of appreciation and demonstrating 
gratitude in thoughtful ways. 
It is not expecting the husband to wear a halo or the wife to have wings of an angel. 
It is not looking for perfection in each other.

It is cultivating flexibility, patience, understanding and a sense of humor. 
It is having the capacity to forgive and forget. 
It is giving each other an atmosphere in which each can grow.

It is finding room for the things of the spirit. 
It is a common search for the good and the beautiful.
It is establishing a relationship in which the independence is equal, dependence is mutual and the obligation is reciprocal. 
It is not only marrying the right partner, it is being the right partner.


## DECLARATION OF INTENT

**Celebrant**:
Ciara and Paul’s hands have been bound with Campbell tartan ribbon, just as their declarations will bind them together.

These are the hands of your best friend, warm and strong and vibrant with love, that are holding yours on your wedding day, as you promise to care for each other all the days of your lives.

These are the hands that will work alongside yours, as together you build your future, as you laugh and cry, as you share your innermost secrets and dreams.

These hands will love you and cherish you through the years, for a lifetime of happiness.

These are the hands that will countless times wipe the tears from your eyes, tears of sorrow and of joy.

These hands will comfort you in illness, and hold you when fear or grief confronts you.

These hands will hold you tight as you struggle through difficult times.

These are the hands that will give you support, and steer you to your dreams.

These are the hands that will hold tight your children, and guide them through this beautiful world.

These are the hands that even when wrinkled and aged, will still be reaching for yours, still giving you the same unspoken tenderness with just a touch.

May they always be held by one another.  Give them the strength to hold on and keep them tender and gentle as they nurture each other.  Help these hands to continue building a relationship rich in caring and devoted in reaching for happiness.

# READING Susan
I'd like to invite Susan, Paul's eldest sister, to read "The Beauty of Love"

The question is asked: “Is there anything more beautiful in life than a young couple clasping hands and pure hearts in the path of marriage? Can there be anything more beautiful than young love?” And the answer is given: “Yes, there is a more beautiful thing.
"It is the spectacle of an old man and an old woman finishing their journey together on that path. Their hands are gnarled but still clasped; their faces are seamed but still radiant; their hearts are physically bowed and tired but still strong with love and devotion. Yes, there is a more beautiful thing than young love. Old love.


## VOWS

In honour of their lives together and the relationship they share, Ciara and Paul will now take their vows. As these two people are joined, so are you, their families and friends united through them. Ciara and Paul have chosen you, their friends and family, to be here on this day as witnesses to their marriage. It has been their decision to bind themselves by marriage, and their lives will be strengthened and enriched by the support you give.

_Couple to stand_

## EXCHANGE OF RINGS

**Celebrant:**
The perfect circle of a ring symbolises eternity, an outward demonstration of your pledge of commitment to each other and an inward symbol of the unbroken circle of family.

By the exchange of these tokens of your love for one another, the hand-fasting, and these rings so are your lives interlaced. What one experiences, so shall the other; as honesty and love build, so will your bond strengthen and grow.

Your family is a circle of strength and love. With every birth and every union, that circle grows. Every joy shared adds more love. Every crisis faced together makes the circle stronger. Grant that those who wear these rings may always have a deep faith in each other.

Ciara's ring today is particularly special, because it was the ring that her father gifted to her mother after Ciara was born.

## BLESSING
I'd like to invite Ethel, Ciara's aunt, to give a blessing.

**Bill:** Ciara and Paul, you have affirmed your commitment and love for each other in front of your families and friends.  You have made a promise to each other to live in this union as husband and wife today, tomorrow, and forever. 

Remember to cherish each other as the unique individuals you are and to respect one another’s thoughts, ideas and ambitions.  The wonderful experience of living day by day as married people is about to begin. Go forth to meet it gladly - love life so it will love you. May the source of all life and love bless you - and the wishes of your family and friends strengthen you. May your hope give us hope, may your love give us love.

**I now pronounce you husband and wife.  You may kiss the bride!**
